# Data-Visualization-in-Python
Performing Data visualisation in python using matplotlib libraries.

- The dataset used is office_2.csv that contains the items sold and the growth projected of a company in the year 2014 and 2015.
- We have dropped a column "Unnamed: 0" since it was not producing any relevant information. And hence we applied data visualisation methods such as Histrogram, Bar Chart, and Pie Chart.
- We have converted the 'OrderDate' to the format YYYY-MM-DD and used sort_index method to sort the values before visualising.
