# Data-Visualization-in-Python
Performing Data visualisation in python using matplotlib libraries.
The dataset used is office_2.csv that contains the items sold and the growth projected of a company in the year 2014 and 2015. We have dropped a column "Unnamed: 0" since it was not producing any relevant information. And hence we applied data visualisation methods such as Histrogram, Bar Chart, and Pie Chart.
